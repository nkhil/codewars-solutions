# Questions

## How do you think about using int Vs int64?
Do you ever explicitly type something as int32, or is that implied?

## Is `panic` essentially like throwing an error?

## How is it possible to do `int('z' - 'a')` ? Are alphabets indexed? [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36803999/golang-alphabetic-representation-of-a-number) might be helpful.

## Using `make` to do something like `make([]int, len(my_list))` , is it significantly better for memory management than not specifying a length (eg: `[]int{}` )?

## Is this kind of declaration incorrect? i.e. do they expect this to be corrected?

```go
func PrevMultOfThree(n int) interface{} {
  // write your code here
  // your function should return an int or a nil
}
```
